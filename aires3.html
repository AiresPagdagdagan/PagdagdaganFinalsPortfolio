                                <p>Design thinking is a natural
                                    characteristic that person have and also it is a
                                    process for a practical and a creative
                                    resolution of problems or issues that looks for
                                    an improved future result. It is the essential
                                    ability to combine empathy, creativity and

                                    business success. Unlike analytical thinking,
                                    design thinking is a creative process based
                                    around the building up of ideas. Design
                                    thinking includes imagination and reason, a
                                    combination of convergent and divergent
                                    thought, and creativity.</p>

                                    <p>And also design thinking allows
                                        solutions to be developed creatively and
                                        quickly, and tested so that it gives a good

                                        around a deep interests or a developing an
