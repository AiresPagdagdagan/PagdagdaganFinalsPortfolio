									group 5 having a brainstorming about what would be our statement of the problem in our presentation
									and besides we are also planning for constructing our Statement of the problem which we decided to
									change the previous statement of the problem into new one which we are all agree, so the design
									thinking process also applied when doing works by others and we have also a plan to do all the possible
									outputs that are bring our presentation more presentable. We also have a discussion to complete the
									presentation. Having a communication to each other to complete the task and put all our idea to one
									and finished the group work task. </p>

								<b>	Collecting</b> those information that revolves towards the in our statement of the problem which is
									very helpful to complete the task to easily identified and easily understand what would be the
									statement talks about.</p>
								<b>Solution</b> to the problem which in this situation we find ways or alternative solution for the
									problem of the person and come up those ways of solution and present it what would it be . </p>
