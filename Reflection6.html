							<h2>R6 - Color Theory and Typography</h2>
								
								<p>Color theory consists of the set of rules and guidelines designers use to interact with
                                    users by attracting visual interface color schemes. To always choose the right colors, designers
                                    use a color wheel and use detailed information on human optical, psychological, cultural and
                                    other subjects. Then besides that your colors have to represent the goal and personality of your
                                    design to maximize a positive psychological effect on the users. Typography is far more than the
                                    option of beautiful fonts: it is a critical component of the design of the user interface. Good
                                    graphics will have a high visual hierarchy the website will have a graphical balance and the
                                    overall tone of the product. Typography can direct, educate and optimize readability and
                                    usability and ensure excellent experience for your users.  </p>
