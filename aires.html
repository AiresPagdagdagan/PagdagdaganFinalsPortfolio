							<h2>R1: My First Few Weeks of USERDES Class</h2>
								
								<p>	In my first weeks of User Design subject online class session, online courses are very
									effective used in online class session like we do it provide easy access to course materials,
									classroom discussions, and feedback to instructors. The course materials and activities may
									access through teams, so that it will comfort even if you’re at home. My first week in User
									design was full of excitement and full of learning’s we got here in this subject because this
									subject it talks about how to plan and make your work beautiful and think nicely about your
									work design .It’s a great start of having this subject so that we can still improve and learn some
									new things when it comes user design but for now it will discussed through online those things
									about the subject but unfortunately sometimes the internet connection is a little bit slower so that
									its hard time to learn when the discussion started but it’s okay because you can watched the
									recording video of the discussion so that you can catch up the lesson again. The discussion ended
									with interaction between the instructor and students so that it is also nice strategy so that both
									will participate during online class session then the session will end with full of knowledge and
									interaction.</p>
									
								
								<p>	Furthermore, I have learned just as much online as I would have in a traditional class. I
									do not have the interactions with the instructor and the classmates, but I can email my instructor
									or my classmates at any time. Online classes have the discussion where all of us can exchange
									comments and ideas about our papers online or any online activities. I do not feel as though I am
									missing out on anything by taking online classes. Actually, I am gaining much more that I am
									losing. For example, I get ideas from them on assignments through online this is a lot of fun, and
									it gives me ideas for my assignments through the use of Google search. This is a learning
									experience for us by the used of online class discussion.</p>
									
								<p>	I've learned that to be a successful distance learner, you have to be self-disciplined and
									able to do some task well on your own. Since we won't be physically going to class each week,
									we can take part in class from the comfort of our own home. We must be self-disciplined
									because the instructor won’t constantly be there to remind you of assignments or of project
									deadlines. Other obligations may mean that we are not able to do the work as regularly as if you
									were physically attending class, it will be up to you to make sure that you are keeping up with all
									the work for the course. Also, one of the main objectives of online classes is to become a wellrounded individual, work with your own or as a group with the skills needed to successfully
									manage a busy agenda</p>
