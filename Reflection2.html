							<h2>R2 : Reflection about Design thinking Process</h2>
								
								<p>	Design thinking processes its sound like creating an art from the scratch which the scratch turns
									into masterpiece because of the design thinking process being planning all the design that been applied
									now we create a good quality of products based on the good design thinking planned by the person. Also
									Design thinking I think it is very helpful to us a developer when it comes designing a project website, and
									other stuffs that need design thinking process. Then design thinking process also a step in every design
									process as a way to enhanced our innovation and imagination in everything to make it beautiful and more
									presentable to everyone</p>
									
								
								<p>	I also wondered that design is not just beautiful images, but a set of decisions for purpose and
									sense behind it. These decisions could make a solutions and stories more engaging, interactive and
									provocative which ultimately have an impact on how people see, think and live their lives. So by the use of
									design thinking processes I can now concentrated or focus producing a good quality outputs. Then I will
									use it also the design thinking process to improve performance of mine so that I would able to perform
									clear and not having any mistake so that I delivered it properly in the presentation.</p>
									
								<p>	For the conclusion Design thinking not just concocts inventive arrangements, yet in addition
									tends to the correct issues and focus on the necessities in the most ideal way.</p>
