							<h2>R4 : Information Architecture</h2>
								
								<p>	The focus of information architecture is on effective, sustainable organization, structuring and
									labeling of contents so that the main objective of this is to provide users to complete tasks. And, you must
									also understand how the pieces fit together and how the objects relate to each other inside the structure.
									Information Architecture aim is to help users understand where they are, what they found, and what they
									can expect. As a consequence, the Information Architecture informs the content strategy by defining
									terms and informing the design and interaction of the user interface through its role in cable framing and
									prototyping processes. </p>
									<p></p>
								<p> These are the main components of Information Architecture Organization Schemes and
                                    Structures. How you categorize and structure information Labeling Systems ,How you represent
                                    information Navigation Systems, How users browse or move through information Search Systems, How
                                    users look for information You need to consider the interdependent character of users, content and
                                    meaning to construct these information systems. This is called "info-ecology," it refers to the following
                                    business goals, funding, politics, culture, technology, and resources, constraints Content: content
                                    objectives, document and data types, volume, existing structure, governance and ownership Users:
                                    audience, tasks, needs, information seeking behavior, experience. The Roles of Information Architects
                                    and UX Designers the Information architecture of knowledge is the essence of a website's experience and
                                    forms the foundation of it. Information architects draw from diverse information sets useful content
                                    frameworks and navigation systems. Before adding features, you must build website architecture. 
                                    Infoarchitects build site maps and develop navigation systems that can then be incorporated into UX designs.
                                    The result is an attractive website with high quality that effectively communicates its information
                                    architecture and facilitates interaction with its elements of navigation when information architects
                                    collaborate with UX designers.</p>
