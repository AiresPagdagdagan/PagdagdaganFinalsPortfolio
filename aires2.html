							<h2>Answer the following guide questions:</h2>
                                <h3>a. What is Design?</h3>
								<p>- Design is a plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the
								implementation of an activity or process, or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a
								prototype, product or process. (AskOxford (especially verbs).</p>
								<h3>b. What is User Design?</h3>
								<p>-Then the User Design is the process design teams use to create products that provide meaningful and
								relevant experiences to users. This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating
								the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability and function..( By: Don Norman and Jakob
								Nielsen, Interaction Design, Management, Visual Design)</p>
							<h3>c. What is the difference between User Experience Design and User Interface Design? Why does it
								matter?</h3>
							<p>-User experience is the interaction and experience users have with a company’s products and
								services. To gain UX insights, this might include conducting research to learn about the positive and
								negatives points of an experience and taking those learning’s to make improvements that positively
								impact a user’s experience.</p>
							<p>-User interface is the specific asset users interact with. For example, UI can deal with traditional
								concepts like visual design elements such as colors and typography. It can also look at the functionality
								of screens or more unconventional systems like those that are voiced based. d. Who are the users? Why
								are they important?</p>
							<h3>-Who are the users? </h3>
								<p>The Users talks about who would benefit to a products or the one that can
								possible provide a product. Users are important because it tries to fulfill the user's needs and it aims to
								provide positive experiences that keep a user loyal to the product or brand(Lamprecht E.(2019)</p>
