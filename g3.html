							<h2>G3 : What is Prototyping</h2>
								<h3></h3>
								<p>- A prototype is a partial implementation of a product expressed either logically or physically 
									with all external interfaces presented. “A software prototype is an executable model of the proposed
									 software system. It must be producible with significantly less effort than the planned product. 
									 It must be readily modifiable and extensible. The prototype need not have all the features of the target system, 
									 yet it must enable the user to test all important system features before the actual implementation”</p>

                                    <p>Proper placement of interface elements increases its usability, makes the resource more attractive to users. 
										In some cases, with the help of a competent layout of the site, you can persuade visitors to certain actions.
										 You need to clearly understand what you expect from the resource, what elements should be present on each page. 
										 To this end, at the design stage, a prototype is first created a black and white layout representing a simplified site scheme. 
										 It contains all the main elements presented in the form of blocks, so the client can evaluate the basic concept. 
										 Prototyping helps not only to identify and formulate the main direction of the design but also significantly save time. 
										 After spending a day creating a concept, you do not have to spend a week developing a new site layout. 
										 But this is not the only reason to devote time to the prototype.</p>
                                   <p> Why make a Prototype? Creating a prototype is one of the steps that precede the launch of the final product. In fact, 
									   prototyping your future product or service has several advantages one is Evaluate Technical Feasibility, 
									   Enhance the Quality of your website, Present your Idea to the customers more clearly risk reduction Iterate at a lower cost, simulate , 
									   Real product ,provide focused feedback ,Planning quick And Easy to create a  products.[Shanuj Mishra,2019]</p>
									   <p>The most important advantage of a prototype is that it simulates the real and future product. 
										   It can help attract customers to invest in the product before allocating any resources needed for implementation. 
										   You can test the design's correctness before it comes into production and you can discover design errors.[Shanuj Mishra,2019]</p>
